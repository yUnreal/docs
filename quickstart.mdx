First of all, you will need to install Bun:

    <Accordion title="Linux & MacOS">
        ```bash
            curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
        ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Windows">
        ```bash
            powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
        ```
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

# Installation

Before the installation of Novi, it's recommended to enable the `compilerOptions.strict` mode in your `tsconfig.json`.

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        // ...
        "strict": true
    }
}
```

Now you need to install Novi package manually in your terminal:

```bash
bun add novi
```

This will install Novi in your current directory.

# Starting with Novi

To create our schema, we simply use the `n` constant that Novi exports.

```ts
import { n, type Of } from 'novi';

const Candy = n.object({
    name: n.string(),
    flavor: n.union(n.string(), n.number()),
});

// { name: string; flavor: string | number; }
type Candy = Of<typeof Candy>;
```

Novi is designed to TypeScript users, being easy to extract the type of the schema.

You do NOT need to define the type of the schema manually, Novi will do it for you. Take a look:

```ts
import { n, type Of } from 'novi';

const User = n.object({
    name: n.string();
    nameLength: n.refine(({ length }) => length, n.ref('name'))
});

// { name: string; nameLength: number; }
type User = Of<typeof User>;
```

Note that `nameLength` is of type `number`, but the `n.ref('name')` is of type string. To extract the input type, you can use the `Input` type:

```ts
import type { Input } from 'novi';

// { name: string; nameLength: string; }
type UserInput = Input<typeof User>;
```
